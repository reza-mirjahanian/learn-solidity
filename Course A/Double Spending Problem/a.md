#### **The Double Spending Problem:**

-   In the digital world, items like **digital currency** or **stocks** can be **copied or manipulated**.

-   A **malicious actor** could attempt to send multiple transactions or manipulate the ledger to falsely increase their holdings (e.g., Bob suddenly has two staplers or more money than he should).

    This is known as the **double spending problem**: the risk of **spending the same asset twice**.


#### **Blockchain as a Solution:**

-   Blockchain technology **solves the double spending problem** by providing a **trustworthy and decentralized ledger**.
-   In traditional systems, **auditors, controllers, and companies** are responsible for ensuring the integrity of records.
-   Blockchain eliminates the need for these **middlemen** by ensuring that **ownership and transaction records** are maintained in a **transparent and tamper-proof** way.
