        *   **Storage**: Persistent data stored on the blockchain.
5.  **What is the** `**payable**` **keyword in Solidity?**
    *   **Answer**: The `payable` keyword is used to indicate that a function can receive Ether. Without this modifier, the function cannot accept Ether.
6.  **What are** `**fallback**` **and** `**receive**` **functions in Solidity?**
    *   **Answer**:
        *   **Fallback**: A function that is called when no other function matches the function signature or when Ether is sent without data.
        *   **Receive**: A function that is called specifically when Ether is sent to the contract without any data.
7.  **What is the** `**selfdestruct**` **function in Solidity?**
    *   **Answer**: The `selfdestruct` function is used to destroy a contract and send its remaining Ether to a specified address. It removes the contract from the blockchain and refunds some gas.
8.  **How does inheritance work in Solidity?**

12.  **What is the** `**assert**` **function used for?**
    *   **Answer**: `assert` is used to check for conditions that should never be false. If an `assert` fails, it indicates a serious bug and consumes all gas.
13.  **What is the difference between** `**msg.sender**` **and** `**tx.origin**`**?**
    *   **Answer**:
        *   **msg.sender**: The address that directly called the current function.
        *   **tx.origin**: The original external account that initiated the transaction. It is generally not recommended to use `tx.origin` for security reasons.
14.  **What is the** `**delegatecall**` **function in Solidity?**
    *   **Answer**: `delegatecall` is a low-level function that allows a contract to execute code from another contract, while maintaining the context (storage, `msg.sender`, etc.) of the calling contract.
15.  **What are events in Solidity, and how are they used?**
    *   **Answer**: Events are used to log data on the blockchain. They allow contracts to communicate with external applications by emitting logs that external applications can listen to.

### **Smart Contract Security**

1.  **What is a reentrancy attack?**
    *   **Answer**: A reentrancy attack occurs when a contract calls an external contract, and the external contract calls back into the original contract before the first function call is completed. This can lead to unexpected behavior or drained funds.
2.  **How can you prevent reentrancy attacks?**
    *   **Answer**: Reentrancy attacks can be prevented using the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern, or by using `ReentrancyGuard` from libraries like OpenZeppelin.
3.  **What is the** `**Checks-Effects-Interactions**` **pattern?**
    *   **Answer**: The **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern ensures that state changes (effects) are made before interacting with external contracts. This minimizes the risk of reentrancy attacks.
4.  **What is integer overflow/underflow, and how can it be prevented?**
    *   **Answer**: Integer overflow occurs when a number exceeds its maximum value, and underflow occurs when a number goes below its minimum value. These can be prevented by using Solidity 0.8+ (which includes built-in overflow checks) or by using libraries like `SafeMath`.
5.  **What is front-running, and how can you mitigate it?**
    *   **Answer**: Front-running occurs when an attacker observes a pending transaction and submits a similar transaction with a higher gas price to get executed first. It can be mitigated using techniques like **commit-reveal schemes**, **time-locks**, or **randomness**.
6.  **What is the purpose of the** `**SafeMath**` **library?**
    *   **Answer**: `SafeMath` is a Solidity library used to prevent integer overflow and underflow by providing safe arithmetic operations.

        *   Phishing via `tx.origin`.
8.  **How do you handle exceptions in Solidity?**
    *   **Answer**: Exceptions in Solidity are handled using `require`, `assert`, and `revert`. These functions stop execution and revert the transaction if a condition is not met.
9.  **What is the** `**selfdestruct**` **vulnerability?**
    *   **Answer**: If a contract has the `selfdestruct` function, it can be destroyed, removing its bytecode from the blockchain. If not properly secured, malicious actors could trigger `selfdestruct`, leading to unexpected contract termination.
10.  **What is gas griefing?**
    *   **Answer**: Gas griefing is a type of attack where an attacker deliberately increases the gas cost of a transaction, making it prohibitively expensive for others to execute.

### **Gas Optimization**

1.  **What is gas optimization, and why is it important?**
    *   **Answer**: Gas optimization refers to writing smart contracts in a way that minimizes gas costs. It is important because executing transactions on Ethereum costs gas, which is paid in Ether. Optimizing gas usage reduces transaction costs for users.
2.  **What are some common gas optimization techniques?**
    *   **Answer**:
        *   Use `memory` instead of `storage` when possible.
        *   Minimize the size of loops.
        *   Avoid dynamic arrays if possible.
        *   Use efficient data structures like mappings.
        *   Pack state variables efficiently.
3.  **What is the gas limit?**
    *   **Answer**: The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that a transaction or block can consume. It prevents excessive computation and ensures that transactions are processed within a reasonable time frame.
4.  **What happens if a transaction runs out of gas?**
    *   **Answer**: If a transaction runs out of gas, it is reverted, and all state changes are undone. The gas used up to that point is not refunded.
5.  **What is gas price, and how is it determined?**
    *   **Answer**: Gas price is the amount of Ether a user is willing to pay per unit of gas. It is typically measured in **gwei** (1 gwei = 10^-9 Ether). Users can set their gas price, and miners prioritize transactions with higher gas prices.
