#### **What Are Flash Loans?**

-   **Definition**: Flash loans are **instant, uncollateralized loans** that allow developers to borrow large sums of money, often **millions of dollars**, without upfront collateral.
-   **Repayment Condition**: The loan must be **paid back within the same transaction**. If the borrower fails to repay, the entire transaction **reverts**, meaning it fails, and no funds are lost or owed.

#### **How Flash Loans Work:**

-   **Process**:
    1.  Borrow funds from **liquidity providers**.
    2.  Use the borrowed funds to **transact** on the blockchain (e.g., trading, arbitrage).
    3.  Repay the loan within the same transaction.
    4.  **Profits** can be kept if the transaction is successful.
-   **Fail-Safe**: If the transaction is **not profitable** or the loan isn't repaid, the transaction **reverts**, providing an extra layer of protection for the borrower.
