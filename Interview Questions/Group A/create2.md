### **Key Points:**

#### **1. `create` Function:**

-   **Address Calculation**:
    -   The contract address is calculated using:
        -   The **sender's address**.
        -   The **nonce** (a counter that increments with each transaction by the sender).
-   **Predictability**:
    -   The address is **less predictable** because the **nonce** changes between transactions, making it unreliable for future deployments.

#### **2. `create2` Function:**

-   **Address Calculation**:
    -   The contract address is calculated using:
        -   The **sender's address**.
        -   A **salt value** (provided by the sender).
        -   The contract's **initialization code**.
-   **Flexibility**:
    -   Offers **more flexibility** in choosing the contract's address by adjusting the **salt value** or **contract bytecode**.
    -   **Predictable addresses**: The address can be predicted more reliably, making `create2` a better option for **future deployments** where the address needs to be known in advance.

### **Main Difference**:

-   **`create`** uses the **nonce** for address calculation, which can change, making it less reliable for address predictability.
-   **`create2`** allows the use of a **salt value** and contract bytecode, providing **greater control** and **predictability** over the contract's address.

### **Takeaway**:

-   **`create2`** is preferred for **future deployments** where knowing the contract address beforehand is important.

The `CREATE2` opcode is a feature in Ethereum that was introduced as part of the Constantinople upgrade in February 2019. [It allows developers to deploy smart contracts at a deterministic address, which is calculated based on the deployer's address, a provided salt, and the Keccak256 hash of the contract's initialization code](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks)[^1^](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks)[^2^](https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/ethereums-create2-a-double-edged-sword-in-blockchain-security/).

### Key Features and Use Cases:

1.  **Deterministic Address Calculation**: Unlike the original `CREATE` opcode, which generates addresses based on the deployer's address and the number of transactions, `CREATE2` allows for the address to be predetermined. [This is useful for scenarios where the address needs to be known in advance](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks)[^1^](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks)[^3^](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/smart-contracts/how-to-use-create2-to-predetermine-contract-addresses).

2.  **Upgradeable Smart Contracts**: `CREATE2` enables the redeployment of smart contracts at the same address. [This is particularly useful for upgrading contract code to add new features or fix vulnerabilities without changing the contract's address](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks)[^1^](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks).

3.  **State Channels**: In state channels, which aim to improve blockchain scalability and transaction speed by moving transactions off-chain, `CREATE2` can be used to create counterfactual smart contracts. [These contracts are created off-chain at a deterministic address and only deployed if needed](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks)[^1^](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/what-is-create2-in-ethereum-and-what-are-its-security-risks).

### Security Implications:

While `CREATE2` offers significant advantages, it also introduces potential security risks. For example, attackers can exploit this feature by tricking users into approving transactions for contracts that haven't been deployed yet. [Once the user grants approval, the attacker can deploy a malicious contract to that address, potentially compromising the user's funds](https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/ethereums-create2-a-double-edged-sword-in-blockchain-security/)
